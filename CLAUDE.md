### Core Rules

1. **Don't write code until I tell you to.** I need to check the logic first.
2. **Only write the code I ask for.** Don't add extra features.
3. **If you get an error, stop and ask me.** This prevents getting stuck.
4. **Tell me if you are unsure about anything.** This is to avoid risks.
